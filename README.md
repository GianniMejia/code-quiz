# code-quiz

This quiz app was designed using dynamic html and javascript. 

When the player starts the quiz, the countdown timer is initialized and begins counting down from 100. 

The app keeps record of right and wrong scores. Every wrong answer subtracts 3 seconds.

Player's high scores are stored and can be viewed even after the browser as been closed.
